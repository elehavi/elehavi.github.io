                    I'm a PhD student in the <a href= "https://hsc.ucsc.edu/">Hardware Systems Collective</a> at UC Santa Cruz, and am advised by <a href="https://www.dustinrichmond.com/">Dustin Richmond</a>.
                    I'm broadly interested in Computer Architecture and Hardware, and enjoy the intersection of theory and hardware. I am also interested in FPGA's, High-Performance Computing, memory and storage, and energy efficiency. 
                    My current project is implementing a MatMul-free neural network accelerator using ternary weights on an FPGA.
                    My Bachelor's degree is from Scripps College in Art and Computer Science. I did my CS major through Harvey Mudd's program.
                    Outside of CS/CE, I enjoy drawing, making and reading comics, non-human simians, tea, desserts, and maintaining a healthy sleep schedule. I also speak English and Hebrew fluently, and am learning Spanish.
